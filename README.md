# Chat

A bootcamp project, this expanded to become an open-source web-based chat application with customizable user and chatroom profiles.

Even the users are open, all people can be found and if you connect with them, they can join any chatroom you are a member of.

Try it out via [GitHub Pages](https://jamesmonks.github.io/Chat/).
