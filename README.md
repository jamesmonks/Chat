# Chat

A bootcamp project, this expanded to become an open-source web-based chat application with customizable user and chatroom profiles.

Even the users are open, all people can be found and if you connect with them, they can join any chatroom you are a member of.

Try it out via [GitHub Pages](https://jamesmonks.github.io/Chat/).

# About this project

During this project I learned to transition from thinking in terms of relational databases (MySQL) to NoSQL databases. This was my foray into Firebase's realtime database, it's web API and managing multi-user authentication.

I used jQuery, Bootstrap and CSS. This project is in the process of refactoring as I have come to know how to better implement this project.
